* Cyclic dependencies of QML components
- See: http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2013-August/012576.html
* ARM support
* Namespace support
* Automatic loading of dependencies
* Preinitialization of global QML structure. Currently it is compiled in JIT in every engine creation.
* Integer / floating point optimization. When compiling module all code need to be compiled as floating point.
  Improve so that functions get compiled as two variants.
