* Cyclic dependencies of QML components
- See: http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2013-August/012576.html
* ARM support
* Namespace support
* Automatic loading of dependencies
* Preinitialization of global QML structure. Currently it is compiled in JIT in every engine creation.
* Integer / floating point optimization. When compiling module all code need to be compiled as floating point.
  Improve so that functions get compiled as two variants.
* Figure out if there's a way to create loader component that does not require changes to the Qt
* More examples
* Find ways to optimize Qml loading even further
* Lots of TBD items in the code. Some of these are not needed, some of them are. Figure out which ones are.
